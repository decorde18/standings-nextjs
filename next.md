gdif is wrong (GA is wrong) - the max is what is wrng

on division page
// TODO: need a way to not display the tiebreakers component if there are none

-on division select, change unique in mysql- division_league is all messed up- foreign key fields seemed to have deleted

- on division deselected, remove selected division
- when page loads, the divisions are not showing until you click on the season even though the season is selected (see whether effective season, division is necessary)

work on head to head logic

work on multiple teams tied logic

// TODO: no spinner when adding a game and the DB is delayed
// TODO: on add, disable button so can't click 2x
// TODO: similarly for clicking on links

// TODO: tables have the sticky logic but inside the divs they need to work to be effective - the tablecontainer needs to have a height

fix header on not wide screens
fix login component on all screens (not visible on wide not styled on narrow)
